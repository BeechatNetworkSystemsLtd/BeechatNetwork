TODO: How can we include bcprov as a module (since it is a dependency and cannot be included in the .jar)?
I tried doing --module-path "/usr/share/java" --add-modules bcprov.jar but that didn't work because there were a bunch of
"multiple modules with the same name".
I suppose a workaround would be putting bcprov into a seperate folder for itself?
