## What is BeeChat?

BeeChat is an open source set of hardware and software which allows people to securely communicate over encrypted peer-to-peer short-range radio connections, and without relying on commercial infrastructure.

* **No SIM cards, no Internet required.**
* **No shady tracking.**
* **We all fully own the system, this way, no one can destroy it.**

If you want to send a message to someone outside your range, people in between you two can act as a bridge, without ever knowing the contents of the encrypted message.

## Possible uses

BeeChat is extremely flexible. Here are just some of the ways we think BeeChat can be useful, but the possibilities are endless.

* **Compromised Internet**

    In case of a natural disaster or civil unrest, normal internet may not be functional. In such a case, BeeChat can provide vital communication functionalities to allow users to stay in touch with friends and loved ones.

* **Hacker-proof Internet Of Things (IOT)**
